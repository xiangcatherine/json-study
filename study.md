### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a way to represent data. It is typically used to communicate data
between an application programming interface (API) and a client. JSON is a string with a very specific format and it is formally defined at [http://www.json.org](http://www.json.org).

A great way to become familiar with the format is to look at some [examples](http://www.json.org/example.html).

JSON is:
-   a data exchange format.
-   a way to represent data.
-   a string with a specific format.

JSON is not:
-   a dictionary.
-   an object.
-   an object literal.

JSON does not support:
-   comments.
-   methods.

Attempts to treat JSON as if it were a JavaScript object literal or as anything
other than a string is a common source of errors that can be difficult to find
and debug.

Remember, data represented with JSON looks like an object, but it is only a
string.

## Modeling Data Using JSON: Part I

A kitchen has many items.

-   An electric stove with four heating elements; small, medium, large, and
    extra large.
-   An herbs and spices rack containing chives, lemon grass, and mint on one
    rack, and cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla on another shelf.
